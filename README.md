# ðŸ“š Pandas DataFrames â€“ Continued Exploration (Part 3)

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook **`Copy_of_03_Pandas_DataFrames_Continued_01_Olamide_Thomas.ipynb`**, which builds on previous notebooks to explore more **advanced Pandas DataFrame operations** for effective data analysis in Python.

---

## ðŸ“Œ What's Inside

This notebook covers:

- Advanced indexing and subsetting techniques
- Using `.apply()`, `.map()`, and lambda functions for transformation
- Grouping and multi-level aggregation (`groupby`)
- Sorting with multiple keys
- Merging, joining, and concatenating DataFrames
- Cleaning, reshaping, and formatting data for analysis

---

## ðŸ§  Learning Objectives

By the end of this notebook, you should be able to:

- Perform efficient, readable data manipulations
- Clean and combine datasets from multiple sources
- Apply complex transformations to data using vectorized operations

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** â€“ Core library for data analysis
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ For running code interactively
